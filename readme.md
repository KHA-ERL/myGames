> Bet on your skills, not on luck.

A multi-game 1v1 platform built for users who want to bet **on themselves**, not on meme coins, forex volatility, or 50/50 gambling.

Here at **myGames**, players select skill-based games, place a wager, and go head-to-head against real people — not chance. This is **gamified competition with real payouts.**
